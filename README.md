# Maze Solver Application

This is a maze-solving application using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in the maze.

## Features

- Interactive grid to set the start point, end point, and obstacles.
- Solves the maze using Dijkstra's algorithm.
- Visualizes the pathfinding process step-by-step.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.py` file.
3. Run the application using the following command:

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Set the start point, end point, and obstacles by clicking on the grid cells.
2. Press the `Solve` button to find the shortest path.
3. Press the `Reset` button to clear the grid and start over.
